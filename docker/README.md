PHP-FPM basic Docker container
--------------------------------------

This is a slightly tuned,basic subset 
of what is generated by [PHPDockerIO](https://phpdocker.io), to have a minimal docker development environment.

## Installation
On the root of the project, simply type:
`docker-compose up -d` and it will spin up a daemon running this server on localhost, port 8000.
